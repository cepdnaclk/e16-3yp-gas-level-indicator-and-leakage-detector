## Project Description
![](https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e16-3yp-gas-level-indicator-and-leakage-detector/blob/main/images/gas_system.jpeg)

Gas Level Indicator and Leakage Detector is a system aimed on LP gas tank users and distributors, consisting 3 main areas.
 	 
 * Gas level indicator
 * A delivery system for gas renewal
 * Gas leakage detector

### Gas level indicator
The device display and the mobile/web application will be updated in real-time, displaying the current existing gas percentage in the tank.

### Gas leakage detector
If a gas leakage happens around the gas tank, a gas sensor will detect the leakage. As soon as the leakage is detected, a buzzer will alarm the user about it while sending a notification to the mobile/web application.
